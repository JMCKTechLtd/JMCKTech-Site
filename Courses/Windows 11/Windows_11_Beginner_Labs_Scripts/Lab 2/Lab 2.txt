Lab 2 – File Explorer Fundamentals

In this lab, we’re opening File Explorer.

You’ll learn how files and folders are organised,
how to navigate between locations,
and how to recognise common folders like Documents and Downloads.

Think of File Explorer as the filing cabinet of Windows.

By the end of this lab,
you should feel confident opening folders
and understanding where your files actually live.
