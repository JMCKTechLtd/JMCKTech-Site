System Rule (Non-Negotiable):
 Always replicate the exact layout, design, flow, and interactivity of Lab 1 (see reference HTML). Do not change aesthetics, features, or behaviors unless explicitly instructed. Any deviation = error.
When building Lab [X]:
    1. Structure & Layout

        ◦ Full HTML file with embedded CSS + JS (self-contained, no external dependencies except fonts/logos).

        ◦ Left panel: “Lab Instructions” with intro, requirements, ordered guide steps, concepts, hints, verification.

        ◦ Right panel: Interactive terminal simulator with:

            ▪ Root prompt ([root@station ~]#)

            ▪ Tab completion box that always appears above the input, never below screen.

            ▪ History navigation with ↑/↓.

        ◦ Vim editor overlay identical to Lab 1:

            ▪ Supports insert mode, command mode, ESC, :w, :q, :wq, :q!.

            ▪ Tracks edits to simulated files and updates requirement progress accordingly.

    2. Consistency with Lab 1

        ◦ Match color scheme, fonts, styles, progress bar, requirement checkboxes, guide-step panels, and concept boxes exactly.

        ◦ Use the same progress logic:

            ▪ Each requirement tracked until completion.

            ▪ Progress bar updates dynamically.

            ▪ Lab completion message only triggers when all requirements are satisfied.

        ◦ Maintain cognitive memory across the lab: previous edits, states, and commands persist and affect future steps.

    3. Functionality

        ◦ Terminal commands must behave like Lab 1:

            ▪ Only accept the correct command(s) for each step.

            ▪ Show realistic system outputs for ip, hostname, cat, etc.

            ▪ Reject out-of-order commands with: “Please complete the previous steps first.”

        ◦ Tab completion:

            ▪ Suggests available commands and file paths.

            ▪ Auto-completes when one match exists.

            ▪ Cycles through multiple matches on repeated Tab presses.

        ◦ Vim overlay:

            ▪ Opens correct file content.

            ▪ Updates internal config state when file is saved.

            ▪ Progress only moves forward if correct edits are applied.

    4. Guide Flow

        ◦ Display the entire question/requirement set for the full lab duration (never hide or remove context).

        ◦ Show each step sequentially:

            ▪ Current step = highlighted.

            ▪ Completed steps = dimmed with “Completed” badge.

        ◦ Include hint-boxes with exact commands to type.

        ◦ Include concept sections that explain what’s happening (same style as Lab 1).

    5. Validation & Interactivity

        ◦ Requirements panel updates in real time when correct configs are applied.

        ◦ Verification commands show different outputs depending on whether config is complete.

        ◦ Wrong or incomplete edits produce error/warning feedback.

    6. Non-Negotiables

        ◦ Do not “simplify” steps into single-task labs; the lab must be one continuous experience that keeps state across steps.

        ◦ Do not alter Vim, tab completion, design, or flow — keep identical to Lab 1.

        ◦ Do not add features, animations, or UI elements not present in Lab 1.

        ◦ Always deliver the full HTML file (no truncation, no summaries).

Output format:
 Provide the entire finished HTML file for the requested lab, fully tested and adhering to all standards above.
