You are generating a full slideshow (PowerPoint) made up of AI-generated images that visually mirror the interface of an HTML-based training lab that I will upload after this prompt.
This prompt must work for any lab file I provide.

YOUR TASK

Using the lab HTML file I provide:

Generate a complete slideshow made of AI-rendered images that visually recreate the lab interface exactly as the user would see it at each stage of completion.

The slideshow must reflect the lab’s actual steps, requirements, and terminal interactions, no matter how many there are.

1. Read & Analyse the HTML Lab File

From the uploaded lab:

Extract and understand:

Lab title

Sections (Objective, Requirements, Instructions, Steps, Notes)

Step order

The UI design (colors, layout, left/right panel structure)

Terminal behavior and expected output

Step progression logic (what counts as “Completed”, “Current Step”, “Pending”)

You will use this to reconstruct the UI visually and logically for each slide.

2. Required Slide Structure (Generic for Any Lab)

For every step in the lab, generate one slide per state, following these transitions:

Slide type A — Initial State

Step 1 is the only active (“Current Step”)

All other steps marked “Pending”

Requirements unchecked except pre-completed ones

Terminal shows intro messages from the HTML

Slide type B — After each step is completed

For every step N:

Slide showing Step N completed (green check + “Completed” badge)

Step N+1 marked as “Current Step”

All later steps remain “Pending”

Terminal must display the exact output that the lab logic would produce at that moment

Slide type C — Multi-action steps

If a step requires multiple commands or actions (e.g., Step 3 requires both cd AND ls):
Create a slide after each sub-action, visually matching how the lab tracks progress internally.

Slide type D — Final slide

When all steps and requirements are complete:

All steps marked “Completed”

Requirements fully checked

Show the “Lab Completed” message if it exists in the HTML

Terminal should reflect the final state (e.g., after clear)

The total number of slides depends on the specific lab’s logic and number of steps.

3. Visual Requirements (Apply to ALL Labs)

The images should accurately recreate the lab UI, including:

Left Panel

Lab title

Objective panel

Requirements list (with correct tick/complete state per slide)

Steps list

Completed = green badge

Current Step = blue badge

Pending = grey badge

Right Panel

Terminal window

Accurate prompt (e.g., [user@lab ~]$ unless specified otherwise)

Simulated command output per step

A realistic representation of the lab’s JS-driven behaviors (like tab-completion, history, file listings, etc.)

Color & Style

Dark theme

Red Hat-style fonts (or approximate equivalents)

Accurate margins, spacing, border colors, and shadows

Same visual proportions as the original HTML lab (usually 50/50 split)

4. Terminal Simulation Rules (Generic)

For any lab you process:

Each step’s terminal output must reflect the actual command in that step

Use realistic placeholder or exact file listings (based on HTML content)

If the step uses tab completion, show a dropped-down suggestion list in the UI

If the terminal is cleared, show a visually “cleared” terminal

Errors should look like real Bash errors

Do not introduce commands that do not exist in the lab.

5. Output Requirements

Claude must output:

A. One high-resolution PNG image per slide

1920×1080 or similar

Each image is a full recreation of the UI at that stage

Filename: labname_step_XX.png

B. A downloadable PowerPoint (.pptx)

Each image fills an entire slide

One image per slide, no borders

Slides ordered from beginning to end of the lab flow

6. Rules & Constraints (Applies to All Labs)

Do not alter the lab’s text, structure, or logic

Do not summarise steps — replicate them exactly

Every slide must reflect a real state the user would see

Follow the lab’s natural progress model (complete → next becomes current)

If input fields or interactive elements exist, include them visually

If the lab has a completion message, include it on the final slide

WITH THIS PROMPT

I will upload:

A specific HTML lab file

Your job is to generate slides that fully and accurately represent that specific lab using the generic rules above.
